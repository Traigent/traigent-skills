# Analyzing Traigent Optimization Results

This skill makes optimization-result analysis **terminal-first**. Instead of navigating the
portal's many tabs, ask in plain language ("how did my latest run in project X do?") and the
skill calls the `traigent-analytics` MCP server, then narrates the answer: a headline, a
confidence label, a few evidence bullets, and a portal deep-link as a fallback. It surfaces a
deeper view (Pareto, leaderboard, correlation,
parameter/example insights) only when the brief's evidence/action calls for it or you ask.

There are two surfaces, and this skill covers both:

- **Cloud / portal run (terminal-first, the default below).** A run that lives in the
  Traigent cloud — analyzed through the `traigent-analytics` MCP tools.
- **In-process `OptimizationResult` object.** The value `optimize_sync()` /
  `await optimize()` returns in your own Python process — analyzed field-by-field (the
  "Working with the local OptimizationResult" section).

## When to Use

Use this skill when you want to understand a finished run. This covers:

- "Analyze my latest run in project X" / "how did my run do?"
- Getting the one-line verdict, confidence, and evidence summary for a run
- Pulling a focused drilldown (Pareto, leaderboard, correlations, parameter- or
  example-insights) directly via its registered tool, with the portal deep-link for
  interactive exploration
- Reading the best configuration and score
- Comparing individual trial results
- Understanding why optimization stopped (stop reasons)
- Checking cost and token usage
- Applying the best configuration for production use
- Reviewing optimization history across multiple runs

## Terminal-First Analysis (MCP)

When the run lives in the Traigent cloud/portal, drive the analysis through the
`traigent-analytics` MCP server. **This skill orchestrates and narrates; it does not compute
analytics and does not do any auth or tenant logic** — the MCP server resolves the caller's
tenant from the authenticated session and returns backend-produced analytics payloads. Treat
every tool response as authoritative and never invent fields, numbers, rankings, or charts.

### 1. Collect explicit project + run context

Before calling anything, pin down **which project and which run**. Never assume a global
"latest" — "latest" is only meaningful inside one project.

- If the user named a project but not a run, ask for the run (or confirm "the most recent
  run in project X" explicitly with them) before proceeding.
- If neither is given, ask which project first.

Keep these as opaque ids the user provides; the skill does not guess or enumerate them.

If the portal shows several optimization runs together as a cohort/group, treat that as
browsing help only. The group is formed from source ids for runs that share the same agent and
canonical dataset; it does not merge configurations, dedupe by tuned variables/objectives/config
hashes, or create one analytics run. Analytics stay scoped to one explicit `run_id`, or to an
explicit `run_ids` list when the user asks to compare runs (see the Multi-Run View section for
the source-preserving cohort table).

### 2. Call the analytics brief first (progressive disclosure)

The keystone tool returns an already-computed backend brief. Call it first and lead with
its headline, confidence, evidence, and any backend-reported action fields — do **not** open a
drilldown yet.

```text
analytics_get_run_decision_brief(
    project_id = "<the project the user named>",
    run_id     = "<the run the user named>",
    intent     = "iterate" | "deploy" | "debug" | "report",
)
```

Use `deploy` for reading deployment-relevant result fields, `debug` for "why is it stuck?",
`report` for a summary/report request, and `iterate` only when you are inspecting the backend's
analysis payload without deciding the next run.

Decision questions are out of scope for this read-only analysis skill. For portal-tracked runs,
route open-ended next-step decisions to `traigent-analyze-guidance` (`traigent next-steps RUN_ID --json`);
for offline/local runs or unavailable service payloads, route them to `traigent-analyze-guidance`.

The tool returns an `ok` flag and a `decision_brief` object. Narrate the brief in this order:

1. **Headline** — the one-sentence verdict, in plain language.
2. **Confidence** — the brief's `confidence`. Never upgrade a `low`/`medium` confidence
   into a stronger claim.
3. **Evidence** — the `summary` strings from the brief's `evidence` list.
4. **Backend-reported action fields** — `recommended_action.kind`, optional `config_id`, and
   `why`, if present. Report these fields as analysis output; do not turn them into this skill's
   decision.
5. **Fallback** — build a navigation-only portal link:
   `https://portal.traigent.ai/p/<project_id>/runs/<run_id>`.

### 3. Pull one drilldown only when the brief or user asks

The brief may include `drilldowns`. The single-run drilldown fetchers are registered
(SDK >= 0.18.0.dev0), so a `drilldowns[].tool` that names one of the registered tools below can
be called directly. Pull at most **one** extra tool per turn, and only when the user asks or the
brief clearly calls for it. Use the portal deep-link for interactive exploration or for any view
that has no registered tool.

The analytics tools this skill may call are:

- `analytics_get_run_decision_brief(project_id, run_id, intent="iterate")`
- `analytics_get_run_report(project_id, run_id)`
- `analytics_get_project_overview(project_id)`
- `analytics_compare_runs(project_id, run_ids)`
- `analytics_list_experiment_groups(project_id, agent_id=None, dataset_id=None)` — requires an SDK build that exposes the experiment-group analytics tools; if absent, fall back to `analytics_compare_runs` for explicit `run_ids` or the portal.
- `analytics_get_experiment_group(project_id, group_id)` — same experiment-group tool gate.
- `analytics_list_experiment_group_configuration_runs(project_id, group_id)` — same experiment-group tool gate.
- `analytics_get_single_run_pareto(project_id, run_id, x_measure="cost", y_measure="quality", request_count=1)`
- `analytics_get_correlation_matrix(project_id, run_id, method="pearson", min_sample=3)`
- `analytics_get_run_leaderboard(project_id, run_id, objective="weighted", weights=None, constraints=None, request_count=1, limit=50)`
- `analytics_get_parameter_insights(project_id, run_id, target_measure="quality", min_trials=10, top_k=10)`
- `analytics_get_example_insights(project_id, run_id)`
- `analytics_render_chart(payload, kind, output_path=None)` with `kind` in
  `{run_pareto, run_correlations}`

Do not call any other analytics tool name. The render tool does not fetch or compute a
drilldown; it renders an already-fetched backend payload. Call it only when you already have a
backend-produced `run_pareto` or `run_correlations` object from a registered tool response.
If the payload is absent, use the portal deep-link instead.

| Symptom / requested view | First surface (only if triggered / asked) | Reported signal / handoff |
|---|---|---|
| Clean winner | (none — headline is enough) | Report the winner and route promotion decisions to `traigent-analyze-guidance` or `traigent-ci-safety-gate` |
| Expensive winner / Pareto trade-off | `analytics_get_single_run_pareto`, then `analytics_render_chart` with `kind="run_pareto"` to draw it | Report the trade-off; route operating-point decisions to `traigent-analyze-guidance` for portal runs |
| Dominated winner / leaderboard | `analytics_get_run_leaderboard` | Report the dominating config; route the next-step decision to `traigent-analyze-guidance` |
| Low trials | (none — state low confidence) | Report low confidence; route more-trials decisions to `traigent-analyze-guidance` or `traigent-analyze-guidance` for offline/local runs |
| One knob dominates | `analytics_get_parameter_insights` | Report the dominant knob; route space changes to `traigent-analyze-guidance` or offline/local diagnosis to `traigent-analyze-guidance` |
| Flat scores | `analytics_get_parameter_insights` | Report flatness; route dataset/space decisions to `traigent-analyze-guidance` or offline/local diagnosis to `traigent-analyze-guidance` |
| Noisy examples | `analytics_get_example_insights` (safe projection) | Report the safe projection; route evaluator/data changes to `traigent-analyze-guidance` or offline/local diagnosis to `traigent-analyze-guidance` |
| Cost blowup | `analytics_get_single_run_pareto` (+ render `kind="run_pareto"`) | Report cost evidence; route budget/guardrail decisions to `traigent-analyze-guidance` or `traigent-ci-safety-gate` |

For the full tool contract (every tool's arguments and response shape and the geometry-vs-words
rule), see
[references/mcp-analytics-tools.md](references/mcp-analytics-tools.md). For choosing the
*next experiment* once analysis names the problem, hand off portal-tracked runs to
`traigent-analyze-guidance` and offline/local runs to `traigent-analyze-guidance`.

### 4. Multi-Run View (Cohort Table)

When the user asks for multi-run, history, "across my runs", or cohort results for one
agent+dataset, use the experiment-group view. Requires an SDK build that exposes the
experiment-group analytics tools; if they are absent, fall back to `analytics_compare_runs` for
explicit `run_ids` or the portal.

Call the cohort tools in this order:

```text
analytics_list_experiment_groups(project_id, agent_id=None, dataset_id=None)
analytics_get_experiment_group(project_id, group_id)
analytics_list_experiment_group_configuration_runs(project_id, group_id)
```

Each cohort tool is a thin reader over a read-only backend endpoint (viewer role, paginated
where it lists):

- `analytics_list_experiment_groups` / `GET /api/v1/experiment-groups` — list cohorts,
  optionally filtered by `agent_id` and `dataset_id` query params.
- `analytics_get_experiment_group` / `GET /api/v1/experiment-groups/{group_id}` — one cohort's
  summary (404 when the group is not visible in your scope).
- `analytics_list_experiment_group_configuration_runs` /
  `GET /api/v1/experiment-groups/{group_id}/configuration-runs` — the cohort's
  configuration-run rows, source ids preserved.

Present **one** aggregated table labelled:

`grouped by agent+dataset — rows remain individual source runs`

Rows are configuration-runs across the cohort's runs. Include these columns when present:
`experiment_run_id`, `configuration_run_id`, `trial_number`, key configuration parameters, key
measures such as accuracy/score, cost, and latency (bare `latency` is milliseconds on SDKs
after 0.22.0 — see version-matrix: `latency-unit`), `status`, and `timestamp`. Keep source ids
visible in every row; join on ids and never deduplicate by configuration hash.

This is a presentation aggregation over source rows, not a merged analytics identity. The portal
GROUP is browsing help and never a merged analytics run. Per-run analytics still go through the
single-run tools above.

<!-- PROTECTED -->
### Privacy: narrate findings, not raw example values

The example-insights drilldown (`analytics_get_example_insights`) is registered, but it is
**privacy-bounded**: the backend returns scoring metadata only — coarse counts, cohort labels,
redacted example refs, dataset-quality buckets, and templated recommendations.
It must never expose proprietary difficulty, informativeness, ambiguity, or latent feature-vector
values. Do not request, infer, or print such values, and do not paste raw per-example payloads
into the conversation.
<!-- /PROTECTED -->

### Tool availability

Registered (SDK >= 0.18.0.dev0): `analytics_get_run_decision_brief`,
`analytics_get_run_report`, `analytics_get_project_overview`, `analytics_compare_runs`,
`analytics_get_single_run_pareto`, `analytics_get_correlation_matrix`,
`analytics_get_run_leaderboard`, `analytics_get_parameter_insights`,
`analytics_get_example_insights`, and `analytics_render_chart`.

Experiment-group tools: `analytics_list_experiment_groups`,
`analytics_get_experiment_group`, and `analytics_list_experiment_group_configuration_runs`.
Requires an SDK build that exposes the experiment-group analytics tools; if absent, fall back to
`analytics_compare_runs` for explicit `run_ids` or the portal.

The portal deep-link is a fallback for interactive exploration (hover / zoom / filter) or any
view without a registered tool. Treat every tool response as authoritative; never fabricate
output, charts, rankings, or field behavior, and do not call an unlisted analytics tool name.

## Working with the local OptimizationResult

The rest of this skill covers the in-process `OptimizationResult` object returned by
`optimize_sync()` (or `await optimize()`) when you analyze a run inside your own Python
program rather than from the cloud. The same outcomes — best config, trials, stop reason,
cost — read directly off the returned object.

## Quick Results

After running optimization, the `OptimizationResult` object provides immediate access to the key outcomes:

```python
import traigent

@traigent.optimize(
    eval_dataset="eval_data.jsonl",
    configuration_space={"model": ["gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4o"], "temperature": [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]},
    objectives=["accuracy"],
    max_trials=10,
)
def classify(text):
    config = traigent.get_config()
    # ... LLM call using config ...
    return result

results = classify.optimize_sync()

# Top-level results
print(results.best_config)      # {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0}
print(results.best_score)       # 0.92 (float or None if no eligible trial)
print(results.stop_reason)      # "max_trials_reached"
print(results.duration)         # 45.3 (seconds, wall-clock)
print(results.status)           # OptimizationStatus.COMPLETED
print(results.algorithm)        # Name of optimization algorithm used
print(results.optimization_id)  # Unique ID for this run
print(results.objectives)       # ["accuracy"]
print(results.timestamp)        # datetime when optimization completed
```

> **Identifying a run in the portal.** Runs are labeled by the `experiment_name` set on the
> decorator (`@traigent.optimize(experiment_name=...)`) or, if omitted, by the access-time
> `TRAIGENT_EXPERIMENT_NAME` env var, then the deterministic self-describing default
> `"<func_name>[<obj1>,<obj2>,...][<knob1>,...]"`, then bare `func.__name__` only when no
> objectives or knobs were registered. The current SDK has no `tags`/`metadata` argument.
> To make runs easy to find later, give each one a descriptive `experiment_name` before you run it.
> See `traigent-setup-decorator` -> "Naming and Labeling Runs".

`best_score` is `None` when no trial produced a valid score (e.g., all trials failed). Always check before comparing:

```python
if results.best_score is not None:
    print(f"Best accuracy: {results.best_score:.2%}")
else:
    print("No successful trials produced a score")
```

## Reading Trials

Each trial in `results.trials` is a `TrialResult` with full details about what happened:

```python
for trial in results.trials:
    print(f"Trial {trial.trial_id}")
    print(f"  Config: {trial.config}")
    print(f"  Status: {trial.status}")        # TrialStatus enum
    print(f"  Duration: {trial.duration:.1f}s")
    print(f"  Metrics: {trial.metrics}")       # {"accuracy": 0.85, "latency": 1200.0}  # latency in ms on SDKs after 0.22.0 (see version-matrix: latency-unit)
    print(f"  Successful: {trial.is_successful}")
    print(f"  Timestamp: {trial.timestamp}")

    # Safe metric access with default
    accuracy = trial.get_metric("accuracy", default=0.0)
    latency = trial.get_metric("latency", default=None)  # ms on SDKs after 0.22.0 (see version-matrix: latency-unit)

    # Check for errors
    if trial.error_message:
        print(f"  Error: {trial.error_message}")

    # Trial metadata (additional context)
    if trial.metadata:
        print(f"  Metadata: {trial.metadata}")
```

### Filtering Trials

Use the built-in properties to filter trials by outcome:

```python
# Only successful trials
for trial in results.successful_trials:
    print(f"{trial.config} -> accuracy={trial.get_metric('accuracy')}")

# Only failed trials
for trial in results.failed_trials:
    print(f"FAILED: {trial.config} -> {trial.error_message}")

# Success rate
print(f"Success rate: {results.success_rate:.0%}")
# e.g., "Success rate: 80%"
```

### Comparing Trial Configurations

Find which configuration parameters matter most:

```python
# Sort trials by a specific metric
sorted_trials = sorted(
    results.successful_trials,
    key=lambda t: t.get_metric("accuracy", 0.0),
    reverse=True,
)

# Show top 3
for i, trial in enumerate(sorted_trials[:3], 1):
    print(f"#{i}: accuracy={trial.get_metric('accuracy'):.3f} config={trial.config}")

# Compare best vs worst
if len(sorted_trials) >= 2:
    best = sorted_trials[0]
    worst = sorted_trials[-1]
    for key in best.config:
        if best.config[key] != worst.config[key]:
            print(f"  {key}: best={best.config[key]}, worst={worst.config[key]}")
```

### Is the Delta Real? Rerun Noise, Paired Comparisons, and Non-Portable Winners

Before reporting any config-A-vs-config-B difference, know the noise floor — field-measured on
real benchmark runs (2026-07): **the same config on the same data, nothing changed,
moved ±5–10 pp across days at n=40 examples per cell** (one cell measured 82.5 → 87.5 → 95.0
across three passes). Three rules follow:

1. **Resolution rule:** rerun noise follows a √k law — the same-config SD is ≈ `50/√k` pp at
   p≈0.5 (≈8 pp at k=40, consistent with the ±5–10 pp above), so a k-example evaluation resolves
   only gaps several times that. Marginal means pooled over ≥4 cells (n ≥ 160) roughly halve the
   noise (4× the samples → √4 = 2× tighter); single-cell deltas under ~10 pp are unreportable.
2. **Pair, don't cross-compare:** never compare numbers measured in different sessions/days.
   Case study: an apparent 12-pp effort-knob gap dissolved to +1.2 pp (2 answers in 160 — noise)
   once both sides were rerun same-day on the same fold. Cross-day deltas were the artifact.
3. **Ship deltas with a bootstrap CI** over held-out examples (≥1,000 resamples); a win is
   claimable only if the CI excludes zero. The same skepticism applies to public leaderboard
   gaps of a few points.

**Winning configs do not port across model families.** Identical knob grids on two families kept
the knob *ranking* but flipped the *optimum* (one model peaked with full schema context; the
other did better on the compact variant — full slightly hurt it). Re-optimize per model; never
copy a winner onto a new model and report the old score.

### Per-Example Diagnostics: Your Eval Set Is Also Under Test

Across N trials every eval row gets scored N times — which makes the run itself an audit of the
dataset, at zero additional API cost. Two independent signals (both field-validated 2026-07):

- **Variance flags.** The portal's Deterministic Insights flag rows whose pass/fail flips in
  ways overall trial quality doesn't explain ("high variance unexplained by trial quality").
  Read them as: *this row's verdict can't be trusted for this model*. On inspection a subset is
  intrinsically defective (one flagged row's gold answered a different question than asked, and
  replicated as unstable on a second model family); the rest are model-specific instability.
  Treat the two causes differently: fix or drop **only** rows confirmed as defective gold (wrong
  or ambiguous, replicated across model families). **Keep** the model-instability rows in the set
  and report them as an instability signal — those are exactly where the model is weak, so
  deleting them before a promotion decision cherry-picks the easy items and inflates the promoted
  score.
- **Token-runaway.** A row that hits the token cap (`finish_reason == "length"`) or burns
  outlier reasoning tokens under *every* config is usually a broken item (ambiguous or
  self-contradictory) — one such row was later confirmed removed by GSM8K-Platinum's expert
  audit. Report it as a dataset fix, not a model problem.

Mapping trap: the SDK keys rows as `example_{<0-based row index in the eval_dataset file>}`
(`traigent/evaluators/base.py`). The portal's separate `example_num` field has undefined
semantics — map flags back to your dataset via `example_id`, never `example_num`. Built-in
evaluators emit those `example_{index}` keys automatically; a custom evaluator should set
`example_id` to a real per-row id (e.g. `example.metadata.get("id", index)`) so the two keyings
line up.

### Configuration Insights

Use `get_optimization_insights(results)` for a first structured pass over top configurations,
performance summary, parameter insights, and recommendations. Treat it as analysis input; deciding
the next experiment belongs in `traigent-analyze-guidance` for portal-tracked runs or `traigent-analyze-guidance`
for offline/local runs.

```python
from traigent.utils.insights import get_optimization_insights

insights = get_optimization_insights(results)
print(insights.get("top_configurations", []))
print(insights.get("performance_summary", {}))
print(insights.get("parameter_insights", {}))
print(insights.get("recommendations", []))
```

## Cost and Performance

Track what the optimization run cost in API spend and tokens:

```python
# Total cost across all trials (None if not tracked)
if results.total_cost is not None:
    print(f"Total cost: ${results.total_cost:.4f}")

# Total tokens consumed (None if not tracked)
if results.total_tokens is not None:
    print(f"Total tokens: {results.total_tokens:,}")

# Aggregated experiment statistics
stats = results.experiment_stats
print(f"Total duration: {stats.total_duration:.1f}s")
print(f"Total cost: ${stats.total_cost:.4f}")
print(f"Unique configurations tested: {stats.unique_configurations}")
print(f"Average trial duration: {stats.average_trial_duration:.1f}s")
print(f"Cost per configuration: ${stats.cost_per_configuration:.4f}")
print(f"Trial counts: {stats.trial_counts}")
# Trial counts: {"total": 10, "completed": 8, "failed": 2, ...}

# Best metrics from the winning trial
print(f"Best metrics: {results.best_metrics}")
# {"accuracy": 0.92, "latency": 800.0}  # latency in ms on SDKs after 0.22.0 (see version-matrix: latency-unit)
```

> **`None` means *not tracked*, not *local*.** `results.total_cost` / `total_tokens` are
> aggregated locally from per-trial metrics and read `None` only when no positive cost was captured
> (mock/offline runs, unpriced custom models — see `traigent-optimize-run` → Cost Wiring Probe).
> A real paid run — local or portal-tracked — should show a positive `total_cost`; treat
> `None`/`0.0` with real calls as cost not wired, never as "expected for a local run".
> Per-trial: `trial.get_metric("total_cost")` is the trial total. `"cost"` is the per-trial total
> on SDKs after 0.22.0 (see version-matrix: `cost-unit`) — it reconciles with `total_cost`, and the
> per-example mean moved to `"cost_per_example_mean"`. On 0.22.0 and earlier, local runs reported
> `"cost"` as the per-example mean — ~N× smaller than hybrid runs of the same config.

## The Quality / Cost / Latency Trade-off (multi-objective)

After a multi-objective run (`objectives=["accuracy", "cost"]`), the single `best_score` no longer
tells the whole story — you want the **trade-off set** (the Pareto frontier): the configurations
where you cannot improve one objective without sacrificing another.

Get one aggregated row per configuration with `to_aggregated_dataframe()` (groups repeated samples
of the same config and averages each metric), then filter to the non-dominated set:

```python
df = results.to_aggregated_dataframe(primary_objective="accuracy")
# One row per unique config. Columns: config params + samples_count + each metric as its mean
# under its BARE name (e.g. "accuracy", "cost", "latency" in ms) + "duration" (mean total
# wall-clock seconds) + "avg_response_time_ms" / "avg_response_time" (mean PER-CALL latency, in
# ms / seconds) when the run recorded per-call timings. "duration" (total wall-clock) is a
# DIFFERENT metric from the per-call "latency"/"avg_response_time_ms" — don't read one for the other.
print(df.columns.tolist())  # confirm the exact metric column names for your run

# Guard the frontier against rerun noise — see "Is the Delta Real?" above. Without this, a
# few-point sampling blip makes a config momentarily non-dominated and a noise artifact lands
# on the frontier. Two guards: drop under-sampled configs, and require a config to BEAT
# another by more than the noise floor on the quality axis before it counts as dominating.
MIN_SAMPLES = 4     # per-config repetitions; raise for a tighter frontier
TIE_BAND = 0.05     # accuracy gap (≈ the ±5–10 pp rerun floor) below which two configs tie
df = df[df["samples_count"] >= MIN_SAMPLES]

# Non-dominated (Pareto) frontier: maximize accuracy, minimize cost, within the tie-band.
def pareto_front(df, maximize="accuracy", minimize="cost", tol=TIE_BAND):
    keep = []
    for i, row in df.iterrows():
        dominated = (
            (df[maximize] >= row[maximize] - tol) & (df[minimize] <= row[minimize])
            & ((df[maximize] > row[maximize] + tol) | (df[minimize] < row[minimize]))
        ).any()
        if not dominated:
            keep.append(i)
    return df.loc[keep].sort_values(minimize)

frontier = pareto_front(df)
# For a latency objective, read the PER-CALL latency column (ms) — NOT "duration" (total wall-clock):
print(frontier[["accuracy", "cost", "avg_response_time_ms"]])  # use your run's actual metric names
```

Each frontier row is a *candidate* operating point, not yet a proven one: pick the cheapest config
that clears your accuracy bar, or the strongest quality/cost trade-off within your cost budget —
note the tie-band folds configs within the noise band of a cheaper option into it, so the literal
highest-accuracy config may not appear. Confirm your choice with a bootstrap CI on the difference
(see "Is the Delta Real?" above) before promoting.
(`results.to_dataframe()` gives the raw per-trial rows if you want to plot the full cloud behind
the frontier.)

## Find Your Run on the Portal

A run that actually reaches the backend syncs to the Traigent portal, where the same trade-off is
rendered visually. That requires **both** `offline=False` (the default) **and** valid credentials
(`TRAIGENT_API_KEY`): a run with no key can fall back to local-only execution and then is **not**
portal-tracked. The portal Pareto/frontier view also requires >=2 objectives; a single-objective
run shows an "add a second measure" hint there, not a blank frontier. To locate a synced run:

```python
# The portal/backend identifiers (None when offline or local-fallback):
print(f"Portal experiment: {results.experiment_id}")  # backend experiment identifier
print(f"Portal link:       {results.cloud_url}")      # direct URL to the experiment on the portal
# (results.optimization_id is the SDK's local run id, not the portal identifier.)
# Open results.cloud_url, or go to https://portal.traigent.ai -> Experiments and find this run by
# its experiment_id (or resolved experiment_name) to read the rendered view.
```

An `offline=True` run, or a non-offline run that fell back to local (no key), is **not** on the
portal — use the dataframe read above instead.

### Verify the Run Actually Persisted (`persistence_status`)

A portal-tracked run (non-offline, `experiment_id` set) can finish all its trials locally but still
fail to *finalize* on the backend — e.g. a network blip or backend 5xx during the final
session-close call. The SDK retries that finalize call (3 attempts, exponential backoff) before
giving up; if every attempt fails, it does not pretend the run is fine:

```python
if results.metadata.get("persistence_status") == "failed":
    print("Backend finalize failed after retries — the portal session may be stuck RUNNING.")
    print(results.metadata.get("persistence_error"))  # the underlying exception, if any
```

When this is `"failed"`, **do not assume the run synced** — the local `OptimizationResult` can look
complete while the backend session is left `RUNNING` on the portal. Re-check the run on the portal
(or run `traigent local sync`) before reporting a portal-tracked result as final. (Newer SDK builds
— the fix merged as Traigent#1731 — also expose this as `results.persistence_failed`, a bool
shorthand for the same check; check the metadata key directly if your installed SDK predates it.)

The status is not binary — read it precisely (field-verified on SDK 0.21.0 real runs, 2026-07-09):

| `persistence_status` | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `"succeeded"` (or `"skipped"`/absent when backend tracking is off) | fully synced | none |
| `"degraded"` (benign) | **partial, not broken** — trial results *and* finalize synced (the portal link works; trial views and per-example diagnostics are live), only the session aggregation rollup was dropped, so summary aggregates may lag | keep the run; do **not** re-run (and re-pay) |
| `"degraded"` (backend-rejected) | the backend actively **refused** the persistence — `persistence_rejected` is True and `persistence_rejection_reason` explains why (quota/auth/tenant) | inspect `persistence_rejection_reason`; treat as a real problem, do **not** assume it's safe |
| `"failed"` | finalize lost after retries | recover via `traigent local sync`; re-run only if sync can't recover |

The two `"degraded"` cases are distinguished by metadata: benign rollup-lag sets
`persistence_degraded_reason` (trial results and session finalize both persisted — keep the run);
a backend rejection sets `persistence_rejected=True`, `persistence_reason="rejected"`, and
`persistence_rejection_reason=<why>` (the backend refused the data — do not treat it as benign).
The SDK never emits `"ok"`.

The portal may group runs that share the same agent and canonical dataset. Use that group only to
find related source runs. Before applying or recommending a configuration, record the exact source
`experiment_id`, `experiment_run_id`, and `configuration_run_id` shown by the portal/API. A grouped
view does not make grouped configurations a single analytics run, and it does not imply equivalent
configs have been merged across runs.

## Stop Reasons

The `stop_reason` field tells you why optimization ended. This is critical for deciding whether to run more trials:

| Stop Reason | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `"max_trials_reached"` | Hit the `max_trials` limit | Increase `max_trials` if results are still improving |
| `"max_samples_reached"` | Hit the max samples/examples limit | Increase sample budget or reduce dataset size |
| `"timeout"` | Exceeded the timeout duration | Increase timeout or reduce config space |
| `"cost_limit"` | Hit the cost budget limit | Increase `cost_limit` or use cheaper models |
| `"optimizer"` | Optimizer decided to stop (search space exhausted) | Config space fully explored; results are final |
| `"plateau"` | No improvement detected | Results have converged; more trials unlikely to help |
| `"user_cancelled"` | User cancelled or declined cost approval | Review cost estimates, re-run if needed |
| `"condition"` | A generic stop condition triggered | Check convergence_info for details |
| `"error"` | Optimization failed due to an exception | Check failed trials for error messages |
| `"vendor_error"` | Provider error (rate limit, quota, service issue) | Check API keys, quotas, and provider status |
| `"network_error"` | Connectivity failure | Check network connection and retry |
| `None` | Stop reason not set | Typically means the run completed normally |

```python
if results.stop_reason == "max_trials_reached":
    print("Consider increasing max_trials for better results")
elif results.stop_reason == "plateau":
    print("Optimization converged - these are likely the best results")
elif results.stop_reason == "cost_limit":
    print(f"Budget exhausted at ${results.total_cost:.2f}")
elif results.stop_reason == "error":
    for trial in results.failed_trials:
        print(f"Error in trial {trial.trial_id}: {trial.error_message}")
```

## Applying Best Config

After optimization, apply the winning configuration so your function uses it in production:

```python
# Run optimization
results = classify.optimize_sync()

# Apply the best configuration
classify.apply_best_config(results)

# Now every call uses the optimized config
# traigent.get_config() inside the function returns results.best_config
response = classify("What category is this email?")
```

`apply_best_config()` sets the configuration so that subsequent calls to `traigent.get_config()` inside the decorated function return the best configuration from the optimization run. The applied config is also readable from outside the function via `func.current_config` on the `OptimizedFunction` instance:

```python
classify.apply_best_config(results)
print(classify.current_config)  # {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.5}
```

### Config Access Lifecycle

| When | API | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| During optimization trials | `traigent.get_config()` | Returns current trial config. Thread-safe via contextvars. |
| During optimization trials (strict) | `traigent.get_trial_config()` | Raises `OptimizationStateError` if not in active trial. |
| After `apply_best_config()` | `traigent.get_config()` | Returns the applied best config. |
| From optimization results | `results.best_config` | Dict with the best configuration found. |
| From the function object | `func.current_config` | Current config on the `OptimizedFunction` instance. |

### Safety Check Before Applying

Verify results before applying:
<!-- /PROTECTED -->

```python
results = classify.optimize_sync()

if results.best_score is not None and results.best_score >= 0.85:
    classify.apply_best_config(results)
    print(f"Applied config with score {results.best_score:.2%}")
else:
    print(f"Score {results.best_score} below threshold, not applying")
    # Use a known-good default instead
```

This threshold check runs on the optimization/search slice — it gates whether to apply, not whether to promote. Promotion is a separate decision that requires candidate-vs-incumbent evaluation on the holdout slice (see `traigent-ci-safety-gate`).

## Optimization History

Review results from previous optimization runs on the same function:

```python
history = classify.get_optimization_history()

for past_result in history:
    print(f"Run {past_result.optimization_id}")
    print(f"  Algorithm: {past_result.algorithm}")
    print(f"  Best score: {past_result.best_score}")
    print(f"  Best config: {past_result.best_config}")
    print(f"  Trials: {len(past_result.trials)}")
    print(f"  Duration: {past_result.duration:.1f}s")
    print(f"  Stop reason: {past_result.stop_reason}")
    print(f"  Timestamp: {past_result.timestamp}")
```

Compare across runs to see if optimization is improving over time:

```python
history = classify.get_optimization_history()
if len(history) >= 2:
    latest = history[-1]
    previous = history[-2]
    if latest.best_score is not None and previous.best_score is not None:
        improvement = latest.best_score - previous.best_score
        print(f"Improvement: {improvement:+.3f}")
```

)[:5]
for trial in top_trials:
    print(f"  {trial.config} -> accuracy={trial.get_metric('accuracy'):.3f}")

# 5. Convergence check

    # Production usage
    output = summarize("Summarize this quarterly earnings report...")
else:
    print(f"\nScore {results.best_score} below threshold {THRESHOLD}, skipping apply")

## Traigent Interaction Policy
Track an interaction profile and adapt to it. Persona (stable): control=`delegate|guided|inspect`,
expertise=`se|ds|unknown`. Mood (this session): pace=`execute|balanced|explore`. Default when
unknown: `guided,se,balanced`. Infer from explicit user statements first, then recent behavior;
an explicit correction wins immediately. Never store or send this profile anywhere by default.

### Fetch the live profile (when available)
At session or skill start, if a configured Traigent client is available, seed the profile from the
backend with the skill name:

```python
policy = None
try: policy = await client.get_interaction_policy(skill="<this skill>")
except Exception: pass
```

Treat the returned `profile` as the STARTING seed: its control/expertise/pace axes plus
`question_budget`, `options_max`, and `jargon_level` replace the static defaults below. Explicit user
corrections in-conversation ALWAYS override the seed. If the call is unavailable or
`fallback_policy="static_v1"`, simply use the static defaults below; the SDK already fails soft.

- Always be concise.
- Match terminology to expertise. For `se`: plain engineering words; define each Traigent or
  statistics term once in plain language (no Bayesian / variance-decomposition / Pareto jargon
  unless asked). For `ds`: compact optimization and statistical terms are fine.
- Presenting options: show at most 3, mark exactly one **Recommended**, and give one short
  persona-appropriate trade-off per option.
- Autonomy. For `delegate` or `execute`: pick the recommended reversible action and proceed, asking
  only at hard gates. For `guided`: offer options with a recommendation at the key decisions. For
  `inspect` or `explore`: give brief rationale or evidence before asking, and ask before branch
  choices.
- Hard gates — always confirm regardless of persona: paid or provider model calls, sending data or
  private content off the machine, destructive edits, decisions the Traigent service is meant to
  return, and any missing fact the step truly requires.
- Always end by recommending the next Traigent skill or action to take.
- Never weaken Traigent safety: dry-run before any paid run; get explicit approval before real cost
  or before any data leaves the machine; treat service-returned plans and next steps as
  authoritative. Never put the persona profile or any private content into telemetry, run metadata,
  experiment names, logs, or provenance files.
