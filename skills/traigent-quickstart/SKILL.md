# Traigent Quickstart

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Setting up Traigent for the first time in a new project
- Installing the SDK and configuring the environment
- Creating a first `@traigent.optimize` decorated function
- Building an evaluation dataset in JSONL format
- Verifying that the installation works correctly
- Running optimization in mock/offline mode for development

## Installation

### Basic Install

```bash
# Recommended — includes integrations, analytics, and common extras
pip install "traigent[recommended]"

# Minimal, no extras
pip install traigent
```

### With Optional Extras

```bash
# Framework integrations (LangChain, OpenAI, Anthropic, MLflow, W&B)
pip install 'traigent[integrations]'

# Analytics (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)
pip install 'traigent[analytics]'

# All optional features
pip install 'traigent[all]'

# Enterprise bundle (all production features)
pip install 'traigent[enterprise]'
```

See `references/installation-extras.md` for the full table of extras and their contents.

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.11

## Environment Setup

### Development Mode (Recommended for Getting Started)

Mock mode is the keyless dev path — LLM calls are intercepted and return canned responses. Activate it in code:

```python
from traigent.testing import enable_mock_mode_for_quickstart

enable_mock_mode_for_quickstart()
```

…and skip Traigent backend chatter via env:

```bash
export TRAIGENT_OFFLINE_MODE=true
```

<!-- PROTECTED -->
- `enable_mock_mode_for_quickstart()` is the recommended activation path. It is **hard-blocked when `ENVIRONMENT=production`** and emits a once-per-process WARNING so a test that accidentally runs in a deployed system is loud and visible.
<!-- /PROTECTED -->
- `TRAIGENT_OFFLINE_MODE=true` skips backend communication so you do not need a running Traigent backend.
- **Mock scope:** only LiteLLM (`litellm.completion`) and LangChain (`ChatOpenAI`, `ChatAnthropic`, etc.) calls are intercepted. Raw `openai.OpenAI()` / `anthropic.Anthropic()` clients are **not** intercepted — a function using a raw client will make real, billable calls in mock mode. Use LiteLLM in examples that must run keyless.

### Legacy Env-Var Path

<!-- PROTECTED -->
The previous quickstart docs taught `export TRAIGENT_MOCK_LLM=true`. That env var still works in non-production environments for backward compatibility with existing fixtures, but it is hard-blocked when `ENVIRONMENT=production` (an `OSError` is raised at SDK import). Prefer the in-code API for new code.
<!-- /PROTECTED -->

### Using a .env File

Traigent supports `.env` files via `python-dotenv` (included in the `integrations` extra). Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```
TRAIGENT_OFFLINE_MODE=true
TRAIGENT_DEBUG=1
```

### Production Mode

For production, set your provider API keys and don't call `enable_mock_mode_for_quickstart()`:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

See `references/environment-variables.md` for all available environment variables.

## Your First Optimization

Here is a complete working example. This function classifies customer queries using an LLM, and Traigent will find the best model and temperature combination.

```python
import asyncio
import traigent
from traigent import Choices

@traigent.optimize(
    eval_dataset="eval_queries.jsonl",
    objectives=["accuracy"],
    model=Choices(["gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4o"]),
    temperature=Choices([0.0, 0.5, 1.0]),
)
def classify_query(query: str) -> str:
    config = traigent.get_config()
    # Use litellm so mock mode intercepts the call (raw openai client is NOT intercepted)
    import litellm
    response = litellm.completion(
        model=config["model"],
        temperature=config["temperature"],
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "Classify the query as: billing, technical, or general."},
            {"role": "user", "content": query},
        ],
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content


async def main():
    # Run optimization (async)
    results = await classify_query.optimize(max_trials=6, algorithm="grid")

    # Inspect results
    print(f"Best config: {results.best_config}")
    print(f"Best score:  {results.best_score}")
    print(f"Trials run:  {len(results.trials)}")

    # Apply the best configuration for production use
    classify_query.apply_best_config(results)

    # Now calling the function uses the best config
    answer = classify_query("I can't log in to my account")
    print(f"Classification: {answer}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Synchronous Alternative

If you prefer synchronous execution:

```python
results = classify_query.optimize_sync(max_trials=6, algorithm="grid")
```

### Key Concepts

1. **`@traigent.optimize(...)`** -- Decorator that wraps your function for optimization. Define what parameters to tune in the decorator arguments.
2. **`traigent.get_config()`** -- Call inside your function to retrieve the current trial's configuration. Works during optimization trials and after `apply_best_config()`.
3. **`func.optimize(max_trials=N)`** -- Run the optimization loop asynchronously. Returns an `OptimizationResult`.
4. **`func.apply_best_config(results)`** -- Lock in the best configuration found so that subsequent calls use it.

## Dataset Format

Traigent uses JSONL (JSON Lines) files for evaluation datasets. Each line must have an `input` field and an `output` field.

### Example: `eval_queries.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"input": "I was charged twice for my subscription", "output": "billing"}
{"input": "The API returns a 500 error on POST requests", "output": "technical"}
{"input": "What are your business hours?", "output": "general"}
```

- **`input`** -- The value passed to your function during evaluation.
- **`output`** -- The expected/ground-truth result used for scoring.

You can include additional fields for metadata, but `input` and `output` are required.

### Tips for Good Datasets

- Include at least 10-20 examples for meaningful optimization.
- Cover edge cases and diverse inputs.
- Ensure ground-truth `output` values are consistent and well-defined.
- For evaluation dataset creation beyond this minimal JSONL, use `traigent-curate-dataset`.

## Verify Installation

### Check SDK info

```bash
traigent info
```

This prints the installed version, Python version, available integrations, and execution mode.

### Verify from Python

```python
import traigent
print(traigent.get_version_info())
```

### Validate an evaluation dataset

```bash
traigent validate eval_queries.jsonl
```

## CLI Quick Reference

**Start here (keyless, no API key required):**

| `traigent recommend-eval`  | Metric and evaluator recommendations for your task type             |
| `traigent generate-config` | Scaffold a full `@traigent.optimize()` config for your function     |
| `traigent detect-tvars`    | Detect tuned-variable candidates in existing Python files           |
| `traigent info`            | Show SDK version, environment, and integrations                     |
| `traigent algorithms`      | List available optimization algorithms                              |

## Next Steps

- **Define parameter search spaces** -- See the `traigent-configuration-space` skill for `Range`, `IntRange`, `Choices`, `LogRange`, factory presets, and constraints.
- **Choose an optimization algorithm** -- Run `traigent algorithms` to see available options. `"grid"` and `"random"` run locally; `"bayesian"` and `"optuna"` require a Traigent cloud connection.
- **Add multiple objectives** -- Use `objectives=["accuracy", "cost", "latency"]` for multi-objective optimization.
- **Use framework integrations** -- Install `traigent[integrations]` for LangChain, OpenAI, and Anthropic adapters.
