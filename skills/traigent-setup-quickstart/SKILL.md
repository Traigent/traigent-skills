# Traigent Quickstart

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Setting up Traigent for the first time in a new project
- Installing the SDK and configuring the environment
- Creating a first `@traigent.optimize` decorated function
- Building an evaluation dataset in JSONL format
- Verifying that the installation works correctly
- Running optimization in mock mode for development

## Cold Start — First Value, One Step at a Time

**When there's no prior run to look at**, do not open with menus, methodology, or the
advanced sections below. Detect cold start — the user is new to Traigent, has never
viewed a run, and has no dataset or decorated function ready — and walk them to their
**first visible result** one action at a time: one question or one command, wait, then
the next. Never dump the whole pipeline at once.

The linear path:

1. **Find the agent to optimize.** Ask for (or detect from the project) the one function
   that calls an LLM. Just that — don't discuss knobs yet.
2. **Find or make the dataset.** If they already have labeled examples, hand off to
   `traigent-dataset-curate` for the one canonical dataset contract. If they have
   **nothing** ready, use the bundled fallback below — no dataset needed to see value.
3. **Mock dry-run first.** Always run keyless mock mode before anything paid (the "Your
   First Optimization" example below is exactly this). Show the ranked table so they see
   the loop work at zero cost and zero egress.
4. **Confirm the real run explicitly.** A real (paid) run happens only after the user
   sees the mock result and says go — and after the cost-gate approval. Never jump from
   mock straight to spend.
5. **View it in the portal.** Once a real run launches, watch the run start, watch the
   rows appear on the portal, and have the user open and inspect the run.

**Where the plan comes from — honesty rule.** When it's time to decide *what* to tune,
ask the Traigent **service** for the run plan via the `traigent-analyze-guidance` skill (its
`traigent plan` CLI / `get_optimization_plan` MCP tool). Present the **one** plan the
service returns — not a menu you invented. There is **no onboarding/phase parameter** in
the SDK or CLI today, so don't pass one or imply the client picks a phase. If the service
can't return a plan, say so plainly and fall back to a **generic, conservative knob
family** — `model` + `temperature` only, explicitly labeled as a generic fallback. Never
encode task-specific ordering (scout/pivot/routing) in these docs; the service owns that.
Tasks like text2SQL, RAG, classification, and extraction may be *named* as things the
service plans for — but the plan logic stays server-side.

**No agent or dataset yet?** Start from `references/first-value-fallback.md` — a complete
mock-first first-value path that needs neither, then gates any real-provider spend behind
explicit approval and a `cost_limit` cap.

Once the user has seen a first result, hand off to the lifecycle skills rather than
duplicating them here: `traigent-dataset-curate` (real data), `traigent-setup-decorator`
(a real decorator), and `traigent-analyze-guidance` (what to do after a run). Do **not** surface
advanced playbooks during cold start.

## Installation

> **This is the Python SDK skill.** Building in **JavaScript/TypeScript** instead? Use the
> **`traigent-js`** skill — it covers the native JS/TS optimizer (the `@traigent/sdk` package)
> with a different install and API. The rest of this page assumes Python.

### Basic Install

The fast path is the core floored install — sufficient for the entire keyless mock
quickstart because `litellm` ships in core. Install optional extras only after the mock
run succeeds.

```bash
pip install "traigent>=0.19"
python - <<'PY'
import importlib.metadata as md
import traigent
v = md.version("traigent")
if v == "0.0.1" or not hasattr(traigent, "optimize"):
    raise SystemExit(
        f"Bad Traigent install: traigent {v}. "
        'You likely got the PyPI placeholder — reinstall with: python -m pip install --upgrade "traigent>=0.19"'
    )
print(f"traigent {v} OK")
PY
```

> **Warning:** pip printing `traigent 0.0.1 does not provide the extra ...` is **FATAL** — you installed the placeholder package; reinstall with `python -m pip install --upgrade "traigent>=0.19"`.

### Literal First Run (execution-only agents)

Run this entire block in the foreground and wait for it to finish. Do not split it,
background it, or continue after a failed command. The final expected line is
`TRAIGENT-DRY-RUN-OK`.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Mock/offline env is set in bash, BEFORE python imports anything.
export TRAIGENT_OFFLINE_MODE=true
export LITELLM_LOCAL_MODEL_COST_MAP=True

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install --upgrade --timeout 60 --retries 5 "traigent>=0.19"
python - <<'PY'
import importlib.metadata as md
import traigent
v = md.version("traigent")
if v == "0.0.1" or not hasattr(traigent, "optimize"):
    raise SystemExit(
        f"Bad Traigent install: traigent {v}. "
        'You likely got the PyPI placeholder — reinstall with: python -m pip install --upgrade "traigent>=0.19"'
    )
print(f"traigent {v} OK")

    cfg = config or traigent.get_config() or {}
    base = 0.88 if cfg.get("model") == "gpt-4o" else 0.68
    return max(0.0, base - 0.04 * float(cfg.get("temperature", 0.0)))


@traigent.optimize(
    eval_dataset="ticket_eval.jsonl",
    objectives=["accuracy"],
    configuration_space={
        "model": ["gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4o"],
        "temperature": [0.0, 0.7],
    },

    offline=True,
)
def classify_ticket(query: str) -> str:
    config = traigent.get_config()
    response = litellm.completion(

            {"role": "user", "content": query},
        ],
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

print("TRAIGENT-DRY-RUN-OK")

### Use a virtual environment (recommended)

Install into a project virtualenv — it's standard Python practice and it's the friction-free
path here. A **fresh** venv is enough; you do **not** need `--system-site-packages`.

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install --upgrade "traigent>=0.19"
```

`pip install "traigent>=0.19"` resolves from PyPI and pulls `litellm` (a **core dependency**) along with
it, so the keyless mock path — which intercepts `litellm.completion(...)` — works immediately,
with no extra install. Only the LangChain / OpenAI / Anthropic *adapter* clients live in the
`integrations` extra (below).

> **Why a venv instead of system Python?** On modern Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora the system interpreter
> is marked *externally managed* (PEP 668), so a bare `pip install` into it is refused with
> `error: externally-managed-environment`. The venv above avoids that entirely.

### With Optional Extras

Install these after the keyless mock run succeeds.

```bash
# Recommended extras after the mock run succeeds
pip install "traigent[recommended]>=0.19"

# Framework integrations (LangChain, OpenAI, Anthropic, MLflow, W&B)
pip install "traigent[integrations]>=0.19"

# Analytics (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)
pip install "traigent[analytics]>=0.19"

# All optional features
pip install "traigent[all]>=0.19"

# Enterprise bundle (all production features)
pip install "traigent[enterprise]>=0.19"
```

See `references/installation-extras.md` for the full table of extras and their contents.

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.11

## Get Your Traigent API Key

Backend-connected features (the default cloud smart optimizer, dataset synthesis, analytics dashboards, the CI gate, and portal result history) all require `TRAIGENT_API_KEY`. There are two ways to obtain it:

### Portal key (experiments-scoped)

1. Sign up at the Traigent portal and create a project.
2. In your project settings, go to **API Keys** and click **Create key**.
3. This issues a `user`-type key scoped to `experiments:read experiments:write` — sufficient for SDK optimizations and analytics.

```bash
export TRAIGENT_API_KEY="uk_..."   # portal keys use the uk_ prefix
```

### CLI device-authorization key (project-scoped)

The CLI device-flow issues a project-scoped `sk_`-prefixed key with broader permissions (quota, dataset management, full project access). Use this when you need project-level operations beyond experiments.

Run `traigent auth login` in your terminal — it opens a browser for OAuth device authorization. The key is saved to your encrypted local credential store at `~/.traigent/secure_credentials.enc` (secured with `TRAIGENT_MASTER_PASSWORD`); the legacy plaintext `~/.traigent/credentials.json` is no longer read unless `TRAIGENT_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_CREDENTIALS=true` is set for a one-time migration. Then export it:

```bash
export TRAIGENT_API_KEY="sk_..."
```

**Which key to use?** The portal experiments-scoped key is sufficient for most optimization workflows. Use the device-flow key for quota management, cross-project access, or when the CLI reports permission errors.

For the standard path, set `TRAIGENT_API_KEY` once, omit `algorithm` and `offline`, and let Traigent use the default cloud smart optimizer with portal result sync. Use `algorithm="grid"` or `"random"` only when you explicitly want local search; use `offline=True` only when zero egress is required.

> **Prereq for real (non-offline) runs: set `TRAIGENT_API_KEY`.**
> The SDK defaults to the cloud backend (`https://portal.traigent.ai`) when
> `TRAIGENT_BACKEND_URL` is unset — no env var is needed for the standard cloud path.
> Set `TRAIGENT_BACKEND_URL` only to target a dev or self-hosted backend
> (e.g. `http://localhost:5000`). Exception: the `traigent next-steps` and `traigent plan`
> CLI commands resolve `--backend-url` as flag → `TRAIGENT_BACKEND_URL` / the URL stored by
> `traigent auth login` → a local default (`http://localhost:5000`), so for cloud use log in
> first or pass the flag/env var explicitly. (On SDK <= 0.19.x these two commands ignored the
> stored `traigent auth login` URL and always defaulted to localhost unless the flag or env
> var was passed — Traigent/Traigent#1721, fixed in 0.20.0.)
> Portal-issued API keys use the `uk_...` prefix.
>
> ```bash
> export TRAIGENT_API_KEY="uk_..."                              # portal-issued key
> export TRAIGENT_BACKEND_URL="https://portal.traigent.ai"     # optional: cloud is already the default
> ```

### Key Hygiene — Reference Names, Never Values

Observed across multiple coding-agent CLI families (Codex, Claude, Gemini), not one tool's quirk —
treat every rule below as universal regardless of which agent is driving the session.

- **Never print, echo, or log a key value.** `echo $TRAIGENT_API_KEY`, a bare `env`/`printenv`
  dump, and `set -x`/`bash -x` wrapped around any key-touching command are all leaks — each writes
  the raw secret to stdout, which most agent harnesses capture into the visible transcript and
  often into a log file too.
- **Reference keys only by env-var name** (`TRAIGENT_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, ...) in commands,
  code, and chat — never paste or reconstruct the value itself.
- **Treat transcripts and logs as shareable artifacts.** Assume anything printed to the terminal
  or written to a log may be read, copied, or shared later; keep secrets out of both.

## Environment Setup

### Development Mode (Recommended for Getting Started)

Mock mode is the keyless dev path for provider calls — LLM calls are intercepted and return canned responses. Activate it in code:

```python
from traigent.testing import enable_mock_mode_for_quickstart

enable_mock_mode_for_quickstart()
```

<!-- PROTECTED -->
- `enable_mock_mode_for_quickstart()` is the recommended activation path. It is **hard-blocked when `ENVIRONMENT=production`** and emits a once-per-process WARNING so a test that accidentally runs in a deployed system is loud and visible.
<!-- /PROTECTED -->
- **Mock scope:** only LiteLLM (`litellm.completion`) and LangChain (`ChatOpenAI`, `ChatAnthropic`, etc.) calls are intercepted. Raw `openai.OpenAI()` / `anthropic.Anthropic()` clients are **not** intercepted — a function using a raw client will make real, billable calls in mock mode. Use LiteLLM in examples that must run keyless.
- **No separate install needed for mock:** `litellm` ships with the SDK *core* (`pip install "traigent>=0.19"` pulls it), so `litellm.completion(...)` is interceptable the moment Traigent is installed — you do **not** need to `pip install litellm` yourself. (LangChain adapters do require `pip install "traigent[integrations]>=0.19"`.)
- **Mock ≠ offline.** Mock stops LLM *cost* (calls are intercepted) — it does **not** stop *backend egress*. With `TRAIGENT_API_KEY` set and the default `offline=False`, a "mock dry-run" is **still sent to the Traigent backend and appears on your portal** as a mock-data experiment (and counts against quota). For a fully local, private dry-run, also pass `offline=True` (or run with no key). `enable_mock_mode_for_quickstart()` alone does **not** make a run local.
- **Real metrics read 0.0 under mock.** Every intercepted call returns the same canned text, so exact/execution-match scorers score a uniform 0.0 across trials — expected in mock, not a broken pipeline (that is exactly why the example below wires a mock-only demo scorer).

### Legacy Env-Var Path

<!-- PROTECTED -->
The previous quickstart docs taught `export TRAIGENT_MOCK_LLM=true`. That env var still works in non-production environments for backward compatibility with existing fixtures, but it is hard-blocked when `ENVIRONMENT=production` (an `OSError` is raised at SDK import). Prefer the in-code API for new code.
<!-- /PROTECTED -->

### Using a .env File

Traigent supports `.env` files via `python-dotenv` (included in the `integrations` extra). Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```
TRAIGENT_API_KEY=uk_...   # portal key; use your sk_... key here if you used the CLI device flow
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
TRAIGENT_DEBUG=1
```

#### Recommended: have the user paste keys into `.env`, never into the chat

When a user says *"I have my key"*, do **not** ask them to type the secret into the
conversation — it would be captured in the agent transcript, logs, and context. Open the
`.env` file for them to paste into directly. This is both **more secure** (the raw key
never touches the chat) and **better UX** (they see exactly where it goes). Procedure:

1. **Create the file** from the project template if one exists (`cp .env.example .env`),
   otherwise create a minimal `.env` with key *names* pre-filled and values blank, so the
   user only pastes after each `=`:
   ```
   TRAIGENT_API_KEY=
   # provider key — fill the one(s) this project uses:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
   # Bedrock: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= / AWS_REGION=
   ```
2. **Always show the user the absolute path** (e.g. `/home/me/proj/.env`). This is the
   guaranteed fallback — they can open it in their own editor no matter what happens next.
3. **Best-effort: pop the file open in a _standalone_ editor window, launched _detached_.**
   Pick the launcher by OS; never wrap it in `timeout`:
   - **Linux:** `setsid -f gnome-text-editor "$ENV"` — or the first of
     `kate` / `gedit` / `xed` / `mousepad` that exists; last resort `xdg-open "$ENV"`.
   - **macOS:** `open -t "$ENV"` (opens the default text editor in its own window).
   - **Windows:** `start "" notepad "%ENV%"` (Notepad is always present), or
     `Start-Process notepad "$env:ENV"` in PowerShell.

   **Pitfalls that look like success but aren't** (verified the hard way):
   - **Don't** open via the user's IDE (`code <file>` / `cursor <file>`): it can spawn a
     nested instance that *crashes*, and it hijacks whichever IDE window is focused — so
     `.env` can pop up inside an unrelated project.
   - **Don't** trust the launcher's exit code as "opened" — a crashed window can still exit 0.
     Verify the editor process is actually alive (e.g. `pgrep`) **and ask the user to confirm
     the window appeared.**
4. **Pick the provider key by detecting the vendor from the project** (its
   `openai` / `anthropic` / `litellm` / Bedrock imports or config). If the vendor is
   ambiguous, undetectable, or the project uses **multiple** providers (e.g. OpenAI *and*
   Bedrock), **ask the user which provider(s)** and label the matching key(s) in `.env`.
5. **Wait** for the user to paste and save. Confirm `.env` is in `.gitignore`.
6. **Fallback:** if no standalone editor opens (or the user says no window appeared), have
   them open the printed path manually; only as a last resort use a terminal `export VAR=...`
   (less private than the file).

> Never echo, log, or read back the key value. `.env` must be git-ignored — never commit real keys.

### Production Mode

For production, set your provider API keys and don't call `enable_mock_mode_for_quickstart()`:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

> **Before your first real run, verify your model IDs are live.** Provider catalogs change — a
> delisted or renamed ID causes a 404 or a degraded/unpriced trial. Preflight with
> `traigent models --provider <p> --check <model_id>` (see the CLI Quick Reference below) to
> catch typos and unknown ID shapes — but know its limit: the check validates against a
> **shipped model snapshot with pattern-based fallback**, so a retired-but-well-formed ID still
> passes; it does **not** detect provider-side delisting. To confirm an ID is actually live,
> query the provider's catalog directly (e.g. `curl -s https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`
> for OpenRouter). The `traigent-setup-integrations` skill covers multi-provider model verification.

See `references/environment-variables.md` for all available environment variables.

## Your First Optimization

> **Always dry-run first.** Before a real (paid) run, run in mock mode, review the cost estimate, and get explicit approval. See the `traigent` lifecycle skill for the mandatory dry-run-first / cost-approval workflow.
>
> **Real LLM runs require cost approval.** A real (non-mock) optimization is blocked by a cost
> gate. To confirm you accept the cost, set `TRAIGENT_COST_APPROVED=true` in the environment
> (the verified path); some SDK versions also accept `cost_approved=True` in the
> `@traigent.optimize()` decorator. The SDK prints an estimate
> before any trial executes; the estimate may be high (fallback pricing is conservative), but the
> gate is a safety confirmation — nothing runs until you approve.

### Tiny Real Cost and KPI Probe

After the mock dry-run passes and before any full run, run one tiny **real** optimization: 1-2 dataset examples, minimal trials, and the cheapest candidate model. Check both surfaces before scaling up: `results.total_cost` must be neither `None` nor `0.0` with real calls (both mean cost is not wired), and each trial's `metrics` must contain the declared objectives with non-degenerate values (not all `0.0`/all `1.0`). If either surface fails, wire it first — see `traigent-optimize-run` → Cost Wiring Probe for the fix ladder (custom model pricing env vars, per-trial cost metrics, `TRAIGENT_STRICT_COST_ACCOUNTING`).

> **Objective naming rule:** Default: at least one objective labeled `accuracy` (built-in objective or your `metric_functions` key). If accuracy doesn't apply to this problem, name the primary quality KPI after the product concept, for example `valid_schema`, and note why accuracy was skipped.

Here is a complete working example. This function classifies customer queries using an LLM, and Traigent will find the best model and temperature combination.

**Note on mock scope:** `enable_mock_mode_for_quickstart()` intercepts LiteLLM and LangChain calls. Raw `openai.OpenAI()` / `anthropic.Anthropic()` client calls are **not** intercepted — use `litellm.completion()` for a fully keyless dry-run (see `references/installation-extras.md` for `traigent[integrations]`).

**Why the example includes a `mock_demo_accuracy` scorer:** in mock mode every LLM call returns the *same* canned string, so a **real** accuracy metric scores every trial 0.0 — a discouraging all-zeros table that looks broken. The demo scorer below ignores the (canned) output and ranks trials by their config, so the keyless dry-run produces a meaningful table — the same approach the bundled `traigent quickstart` command uses. It is **mock-only: delete it for a real run**, where Traigent scores actual model output against your dataset labels. (Prefer not to keep a placeholder scorer in your own code? Just run `traigent quickstart` for the same ranked demo without writing one.)

```

>
> # CORRECT — function takes input fields only; scorer receives (output, expected)
> def classify_query(query: str) -> str: ...
> def score(output: str, expected: str) -> float: ...
> ```

### Key Concepts

1. **`@traigent.optimize(...)`** -- Decorator that wraps your function for optimization. Define what parameters to tune in the decorator arguments.
2. **`traigent.get_config()`** -- Call inside your function to retrieve the current trial's configuration. Works during optimization trials and after `apply_best_config()`.
3. **`func.optimize(max_trials=N)`** -- Run the optimization loop asynchronously. Returns an `OptimizationResult`.
4. **`func.apply_best_config(results)`** -- Lock in the best configuration found so that subsequent calls use it.

> **You've run your first optimization — now make it robust.** The decorator above is intentionally a *local dry-run* recipe: a small `model` + `temperature` space, `algorithm="random"`, and `offline=True`. For a real optimization, graduate to the more robust **`traigent-setup-decorator`** skill — custom evaluators / `metric_functions`, injection mode, execution policy, and weighted objectives — then launch with **`traigent-optimize-run`**, which adds what a *real* run needs beyond the basic `.optimize()` call: **cost limits** (cap a paid sweep before it overruns), **algorithm choice** (`"auto"` for connected real runs; `"grid"`/`"random"` for explicit local/offline search; named smart selectors like `bayesian`/`optuna` are roadmap, not executable end-to-end), **parallel trials**, and **quota-aware run sizing**. That `decorator-setup` → `run-optimization` pair is the recommended path from "first run" to a production optimization.

## Dataset Format

Traigent uses JSONL (JSON Lines) files for evaluation datasets. Each line must have an `input` field and an `output` field.

### Example: `eval_queries.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"input": "I was charged twice for my subscription", "output": "billing"}
{"input": "The API returns a 500 error on POST requests", "output": "technical"}
{"input": "What are your business hours?", "output": "general"}
```

- **`input`** -- The value passed to your function during evaluation.
- **`output`** -- The expected/ground-truth result used for scoring.

You can include additional fields for metadata, but `input` and `output` are required.

> **One canonical contract.** This flat form is the simplest case of the single Traigent dataset
> contract: `input` (or `input_data`) → your function's args, the **gold key** → the expected value,
> and **every other top-level key** → `example.metadata[...]` (how a per-example side field like a
> `db_path` reaches a scorer). Values may be **nested dicts**, and the gold key has accepted aliases
> (`output`, `expected`, `expected_output`, `answer`, `target`, `label`). See `traigent-dataset-curate`
> for the full contract and `traigent-eval-build` for an execution-scored recipe that reads a
> `metadata` field.

> **Dataset path sandbox.** The SDK enforces a `TRAIGENT_DATASET_ROOT` / CWD sandbox — an
> eval-dataset path outside the sandbox root (default: the **current working directory**) is
> rejected at load with a `ConfigurationError` ("Dataset path must reside under …"). Keep the JSONL under the directory you run from,
> or set `TRAIGENT_DATASET_ROOT` to the directory containing your datasets.

### Tips for Good Datasets

- Include at least 10-20 examples for meaningful optimization.
- Cover edge cases and diverse inputs.
- Ensure ground-truth `output` values are consistent and well-defined.
- Reserve a holdout slice before tuning; never tune and validate on the same rows.
- For evaluation dataset creation beyond this minimal JSONL, use `traigent-dataset-curate`.

## Verify Installation

### Check SDK info

```bash
traigent info
```

This prints the installed version, Python version, available integrations, and optimization defaults.

### Verify from Python

```python
import traigent
print(traigent.get_version_info())
```

### Validate an evaluation dataset

```bash
traigent validate eval_queries.jsonl
```

## Next Steps

- **Configure your decorator for a real optimization** -- The example above is the *minimal* decorator. To make it optimization-ready -- custom evaluators / `metric_functions`, injection mode, execution (`algorithm`/`offline`), and weighted objectives -- use the `traigent-setup-decorator` skill, then launch with `traigent-optimize-run`. This `decorator-setup` → `run-optimization` pair is the standard two-step cycle for going from "first run" to a real optimization.
- **Dry-run before a real run** -- See the `traigent` lifecycle skill for the mandatory dry-run-first / cost-approval workflow before any paid execution.
- **Mind your plan quota** -- Cloud optimization is metered by `optimization_samples` (~`max_trials × dataset_size` per run) and `optimization_trials`, separate from dollar cost. Check usage and size large runs to fit; see the `traigent-optimize-run` skill ("Quota & Run Sizing").
- **Define parameter search spaces** -- See the `traigent-optimize-config-space` skill for `Range`, `IntRange`, `Choices`, `LogRange`, factory presets, and constraints.
- **Choose an optimization algorithm** -- For connected real runs, omit `algorithm` or use `"auto"`; use `"grid"`/`"random"` for explicit local/offline search. On SDK >= 0.20.1, `traigent algorithms` lists the full public selector surface — `auto`, the local names, and the cloud-routed smart names — with a local/connected availability column (on 0.20.0 the CLI omitted `auto` and the smart names: Traigent/Traigent#1751, fixed in 0.20.1). Smart selector names require an authenticated connected run: since 0.20.1, `bayesian`/`tpe`/`optuna`/`optuna_tpe`/`optuna_random` bind to the typed backend Optuna strategy, while unsupported smart names such as `nsga2`/`cmaes` fail fast with a capability message (Traigent/Traigent#1752, #1758 — fixed in 0.20.1; on 0.20.0 no smart name executed end-to-end). With `offline=True` every smart name still raises `ConfigurationError` at decoration time (verified on 0.21.0). The `traigent-optimize-run` skill owns the full selector contract.
- **Add multiple objectives** -- Use `objectives=["accuracy", "cost", "latency"]` for multi-objective optimization.
- **Use framework integrations** -- Install `traigent[integrations]` for LangChain, OpenAI, and Anthropic adapters.
- **Verify model IDs before a real run** -- Catalogs change; run `traigent models --provider <p> --check <id>` to catch typos and unknown ID shapes, then confirm the ID is actually live against the provider's catalog — the CLI check validates a shipped snapshot with pattern fallback and cannot detect provider-side delisting, so a retired/renamed ID can still pass and cause a 404 or a degraded, unpriced trial. See `traigent-setup-integrations`.

<!-- INTERACTION_POLICY v1 (synced — do not edit inline; edit docs/shared/interaction-policy.v1.md) -->
## Traigent Interaction Policy
Track an interaction profile and adapt to it. Persona (stable): control=`delegate|guided|inspect`,
expertise=`se|ds|unknown`. Mood (this session): pace=`execute|balanced|explore`. Default when
unknown: `guided,se,balanced`. Infer from explicit user statements first, then recent behavior;
an explicit correction wins immediately. Never store or send this profile anywhere by default.

### Fetch the live profile (when available)
At session or skill start, if a configured Traigent client is available, seed the profile from the
backend with the skill name:

```python
policy = None
try: policy = await client.get_interaction_policy(skill="<this skill>")
except Exception: pass
```

Treat the returned `profile` as the STARTING seed: its control/expertise/pace axes plus
`question_budget`, `options_max`, and `jargon_level` replace the static defaults below. Explicit user
corrections in-conversation ALWAYS override the seed. If the call is unavailable or
`fallback_policy="static_v1"`, simply use the static defaults below; the SDK already fails soft.

- Always be concise.
- Match terminology to expertise. For `se`: plain engineering words; define each Traigent or
  statistics term once in plain language (no Bayesian / variance-decomposition / Pareto jargon
  unless asked). For `ds`: compact optimization and statistical terms are fine.
- Presenting options: show at most 3, mark exactly one **Recommended**, and give one short
  persona-appropriate trade-off per option.
- Autonomy. For `delegate` or `execute`: pick the recommended reversible action and proceed, asking
  only at hard gates. For `guided`: offer options with a recommendation at the key decisions. For
  `inspect` or `explore`: give brief rationale or evidence before asking, and ask before branch
  choices.
- Hard gates — always confirm regardless of persona: paid or provider model calls, sending data or
  private content off the machine, destructive edits, decisions the Traigent service is meant to
  return, and any missing fact the step truly requires.
- Always end by recommending the next Traigent skill or action to take.
- Never weaken Traigent safety: dry-run before any paid run; get explicit approval before real cost
  or before any data leaves the machine; treat service-returned plans and next steps as
  authoritative. Never put the persona profile or any private content into telemetry, run metadata,
  experiment names, logs, or provenance files.
